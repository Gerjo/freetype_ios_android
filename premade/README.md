Premade freetype fat library with bitcode
====================

Here is one I prepared earlier. Uses Freetype 2.6.2 compiled with bitcode support and arches i86, arm7, arm7s and arm64. Compiled using xcode 7.1

Not sure if it's sensible to create a fat library and include bitcode... but whatever. Separately - the bitcode doesn't seem to be compatible with Apple's version.
